## Angular

This is the Angular front-end for the Simplilearn Capstone Fashionista Project.  
Its a dynamic shopping application built using Mongoose, Express, Angular, and Node.js.  

## Running The Angular UI:
The Angular can be run by opening a new terminal (Powershell) within VS Code or simply on the OS.  
From here move to the ```Fashionista``` project directory and then ```cd``` into ```Angular```.  
The Angular can then be run using the command ```npm start```.
