# Fashionista
Simplilearn Capstone Project

## First Time Setup:

#### Re-Establish Node Modules
This project will ignore each node_modules folder respectively. Therefore after starting you should:  
run ```npm i``` within ```/api```  
run ```npm i``` within ```/Fashionista```  
  
#### Set MongoDB Connection
When you first download the project you will have to insert in your personal MongoDB connection string.  
This should be done through the ```.env``` file which you will have to create in accordance with ```README.md``` located under ```/api```.    
This file is ignored via ```.gitignore``` for security reasons.

## Running The Server:
The server can be run by opening a new terminal (Powershell) within VS Code or simply on the OS.  
From here move to the ```Fashionista``` project directory and then ```cd``` into ```api```.  
The server can then be run using the command ```npm run dev```.  

## Running The Angular UI:
The Angular can be run by opening a new terminal (Powershell) within VS Code or simply on the OS.  
From here move to the ```Fashionista``` project directory and then ```cd``` into ```Angular```.  
The Angular can then be run using the command ```npm start```.
