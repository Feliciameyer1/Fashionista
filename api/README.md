## API Server

This is the API back-end / server for the Simplilearn Capstone Fashionista Project.  
It is built using Javascript (Node.js).  

#### .env File Creation

Before using this program you will need to locally create an ```.env``` file.  
The file should only contain the following:  
```URI = YOUR MONGODB LINK HERE```  
Please note that there are no quotes around your MongoDB link.  

#### Running The Server:
The server can be run by opening a new terminal (Powershell) within VS Code or simply on the OS.  
From here move to the ```Fashionista``` project directory and then ```cd``` into ```api```.  
The server can then be run using the command ```npm run dev```.
